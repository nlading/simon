## Long Description
Simon is a memorization game that requires the player to repeat a series of button presses in a particular order that increases by one each round. Upon the first event that the user inaccurately re-enacts the list of actions handed to her/him she/he loses the game. Simon is often presented to the user in the form of 4 buttons, each one a different color. 

The game presents the series of button presses by illuminating the buttons one at a time and emitting a tone that is unique to each colored button. The User then repeats this sequence of button presses, in order, until the user enters an incorrect button press or takes too long to press the next button in the series.
